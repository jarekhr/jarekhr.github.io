I'm a Software Engineer working mainly in Java, Javascript and Python.
I like building useful software in a simple way and lead to teams to achieve the same.

This blog is a collection of notes, thoughts and findings which I believe can be useful. It's a also meant to be a notepad
where I can look things up if needed.
